## Developing

### Building

<!-- Run go build: -->

<!-- ```shell
go build -o myapp *.go
``` -->

<!-- ### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does. -->
